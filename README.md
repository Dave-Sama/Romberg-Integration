# Romberg-Integration
This method is good for finding an approximate value for an integral solution
The method can be based on the trapezoidal method or the Simpson method
although i will implement Romberg method based on the trapezoidal method. 

# How it works? 

based on the Trapezoidal method: <br/>

next is:<br/>

after N iterations we will have the approximate value for an integral solution.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install sympy and Texttable.

```bash
pip install sympy
```

```bash
pip install Texttable
```
